# Flixx App

Flixx App is a movie information application built with vanilla JavaScript that utilizes **version 3** of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). It provides users with access to popular movies and TV shows, detailed pages for each title, a search feature with pagination, and a slider showcasing currently playing movies in theaters. The slider functionality is powered by the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.

## Overview

This project serves as a side project developed independently, aimed at providing users with an intuitive interface to explore movie and TV show information. It is not associated with any specific course or educational program.

## Features

- Access popular movies and TV shows
- Detailed information pages for each title
- Search functionality with pagination support
- Slider showcasing currently playing movies in theaters

## Usage

To utilize the Flixx App:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Register for a free API key at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
3. Add your API key to the `api.apiKey` value in the global state within the project.
4. Run the application locally.

**Note:** Storing API keys directly in client-side code is not recommended for production projects. Consider using a proxy server to securely store and access your API key.

## Theme (HTML & CSS)

The project includes a theme for the application's HTML and CSS, designed to provide a visually appealing interface for users. This theme does not contain any JavaScript functionality and can be utilized independently or alongside the main application.
